\section{Introduction}

models are complex. CITE ron?
simulation studies are even more complex and they tend to increase in terms of complexity. CITE
in times when collaborations over a distance of thousands of kilometres are mundane, researchers became aware of the importance of reproducibility. Sandve 2013
therefore, there is an increasing demand for means to transfer simulation studies, ensuring reproducibility. CITE
Indeed, reproducibility is an essential challenge in systems biology. CITE Mesirov 2010
In 2011 the pharmaceutical company Bayer tried to replicate published studies and failed in 64\% percent. Prinz et al 2011
Several projects and initiatives already deal with the problem of reproducibility, such as the Reproducibility Initiative\footnote{\href{http://reproducibilityinitiative.org/}{reproducibilityinitiative.org}} and FAIRDOM\footnote{\href{http://fair-dom.org/}{fair-dom.org}}.
