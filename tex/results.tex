\subsection{The COMBINE archive}
During my work I kept the COMBINE archive in a GIT repository for version control.
The latest version of the archive can be found at GitHub\footnote{\href{https://github.com/SemsProject/CombineArchiveShowCase}{github.com/SemsProject/CombineArchiveShowCase}}.
At the time of writing this report\footnote{latest git commit: 2e946ce1adfd05d16350c30176e29546301603a2 -- 2015-06-11}, the archive consists of 25 files organizes in four directories (cmp. Section~\ref{sec:extendingarchive}), including the \texttt{manifest.xml} and \texttt{metadata.rdf} (the skeleton of the archive, see Section~\ref{sec:intro}) and a \texttt{README.md} file for the GitHub repository.
The manifest listing all ingredients of the COMBINE archive is attached in Section~\ref{sec:manifest}.

The archive basically consists of 4 modules: (i) the publication stored in the \texttt{documentation/} directory, (ii) the model of the biological system encoded in standardised formats stored in the \texttt{model/} directory, (iii) the simulation description encoded in SED-ML defining the simulation setup stored in the \texttt{experiment/} directory, (iv) the simulation results in form of graphs stored in the \texttt{result/} directory.
The files in these directories were either retrieved from other websites (publication, SBML model, CellML model) or generated especially for this archive (SED-ML scripts, simulation results, SBGN map).
The goal of this archive is to encode a reproducible simulation study.
Figure~\ref{fig:sim:results} has shown that the developed study is able to reproduce graphs shown in the corresponding publication.
